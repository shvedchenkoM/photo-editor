# Simple Image Editor SIE
This app was designed and implemented like a project for the university as well as a way to implement a photo editor by myself. Now people can add photos and edit them in four possible ways: to change brightness, color saturation, and sharpness and contrast. If it is needed, the user can zoom in on the photo. And in the end, save changes.
